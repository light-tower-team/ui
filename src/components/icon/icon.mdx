# Icon

```js
import { Icon } from "@light-tower-team/ui";
```

## Usage

The Icon component can be used to render any svg within the [feather-icons](https://feathericons.com/) icon sprites.

## Accessibility

`Icon` icons are hidden from screen readers by default, as usages of icons are commonly decorative.

If the icon is not decorative, add an aria-label attribute to `Icon` to give it an accessible name. This label is read out by screen readers.

If the icon is clickable, use `Button` instead of `Icon` because a clickable element should semantically be a button.
